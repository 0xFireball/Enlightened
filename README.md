## **[NEW]** - Use Enlightened's code editor as an Android library!

Enlightened's highlighting editor, which comes with built-in highlighting support for some languages, is now available as an Android library to use in other Android applications! 

The library `iridiumhighlightingeditor` is available in `iridiumhighlightingeditor/`; add
the Enlightened reposistory as a submodule and import the editor library Android module
into your project. Then reference it through Gradle by adding it to the dependencies section:

```
compile project(":iridiumhighlightingeditor")
```

Enlightened is GPLv3 licensed, so projects using the library must also use the GPLv3.
